                <!-- Description of the nonprofit's mission -->
                <p>Looking to make a real difference in the world? charity: water is a nonprofit on a bold mission to bring clean, safe drinking water to communities around the globe—especially where water is still just a distant, daily struggle. Today, nearly 1 in 10 people live without access to safe water—a reality that keeps kids from school, steals time, spreads illness, and limits dreams. With charity: water, every dollar donated goes straight into building sustainable water projects—like wells, rainwater systems, or pipes—that improve health, empower women, and unleash opportunity. Better yet, you get to see exactly where your impact lands, thanks to GPS tracking and photos for every project. It's water, transparency, and action—all wrapped into one powerful movement you can join.</p>
